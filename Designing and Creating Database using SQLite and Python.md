### Designing and Creating Database using SQLite and Python


In this project, we're going to :

- Import data into SQLite
- Design a normalized database schema
- Create tables for our schema
- Insert data into our schema

We will be working with a file of Major League Baseball games from Retrosheet. Retrosheet compiles detailed statistics on baseball games from the 1800s through to today. 

The main file we will be working from **game_log.csv**

In addition to the main file, we have also included three 'helper' files, also sourced from Retrosheet:

- park_codes.csv
- person_codes.csv
- team_codes.csv

These three helper files in some cases contain extra data.

**game_log_fields.txt** file from Retrosheet which explains the fields included in main file, will be useful to assist in exploratory data analysis
